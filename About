--> It supports authentication where users can register themselves and log in to have some special access like adding reviews and creating own campground.

--> It supports authorization allowing only the owner of a campground or a review to edit or delete the campgrounds or reviews.

--> Complete CRUD operation is implemented on review and campground model.
